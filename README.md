## About Ullas Bharadwaj ##
Welcome to my GitHub!
I’m a software developer specializing in embedded systems, proficient in C, C++, and Python. My work spans diverse domains such as Embedded Software, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Algorithmic Trading.
Besides crafting robust software, I’m passionate about contributing to open source—either by enhancing existing projects or publishing new ones if I believe they bring value. While my repositories may not have amassed many stars yet, I invite you to explore them—there might just be some star-worthy gems waiting to be discovered. 😛
Feel free to dive into my projects, share your thoughts, or collaborate. Who knows? You might find the next big thing right here.
